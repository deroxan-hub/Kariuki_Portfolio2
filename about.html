    <h1>About Kariuki</h1>
            <!-- Paragraph -->
             <p>I am a graduate student with a Degree in Corporate Communication and Management from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology</p>
             <p> As a result of working within the Construction industry as an intern at Crown Paints Kenya PLC within the Business Development Department for more than five months, i have gained experience and appropriate skills within the professional sector</p>
             <p>As a result of my hard work, i received an extension to continue working until I finished school and graduated in June, 2025</p>
             <p>My interest in coding and Development came about as a result of the exposure the school has given me, whereby i have had the opportunty to learn about the value of having IT skills such as coding. This aroused my curiosity, and thus I began my coding journey, whereby Power Learning Project was able to make that dream a success.</p>
             <p>I am slowly growing my skills and portfolio using gaining an aptitude to create using languages such as Python and CSS</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books on technology and business and exploring new programming languages, and contributing to open-source projects.</p>
